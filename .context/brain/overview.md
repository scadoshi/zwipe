# Learning Progress Tracker

Tracks learning progress across confidence levels for AI teaching optimization.

**Last Updated**: Restructured into modular files for better AI context management.

## Confidence Level Index

Navigate to specific confidence level files:

- **[confident.md](brain/confident.md)** - What you can teach others without hesitation
- **[developing.md](brain/developing.md)** - Working implementations where you're still building deep understanding
- **[learning.md](brain/learning.md)** - Recently introduced concepts requiring guidance
- **[unexplored.md](brain/unexplored.md)** - Future learning areas not yet encountered

## Update Instructions for AI Assistants

**Confidence Levels**: CONFIDENT = Could teach others without hesitation. DEVELOPING = Successfully implemented but still learning. LEARNING = Recently introduced, needs guidance. UNEXPLORED = Not yet encountered.

**When to Update**: After major implementations, quiz performance, or when user demonstrates clear confidence level changes. Move concepts between levels based on demonstrated understanding and teaching ability.

**Quiz Strategy**: Continue giving pop quizzes in chat to validate understanding and strengthen knowledge. Focus on recent implementations and concepts showing uncertainty.

**File Structure**: Keep individual files focused and under 300 lines for efficient AI context loading. When a category grows too large, consider further subdivision.
