## Update Instructions for AI Assistants

**Confidence Levels**: CONFIDENT = Could teach others without hesitation. DEVELOPING = Successfully implemented but still learning. LEARNING = Recently introduced, needs guidance. UNEXPLORED = Not yet encountered.

**When to Update**: After major implementations, quiz performance, or when user demonstrates clear confidence level changes. Move concepts between levels based on demonstrated understanding and teaching ability.

**Quiz Strategy**: Continue giving pop quizzes in chat to validate understanding and strengthen knowledge. Focus on recent implementations and concepts showing uncertainty.

## Current Learning Status

**Last Updated**: Session domain modeling and refresh token architecture design

**Next Learning Focus**: SQLx session repository implementation, service orchestration with token generation, HTTP handler patterns

**Recent Achievement**: Completed comprehensive session domain architecture. Built Session struct containing user data plus both access and refresh tokens with their expiration timestamps. Designed complete request/error type system (CreateSession, RefreshSession, RevokeSessions) with proper error handling. Learned distinction between access tokens (JWTs, self-contained) and refresh tokens (opaque random bytes, hashed for storage). Understood SHA-256 vs Argon2 tradeoffs for token hashing (speed vs security needs). Created visual flow diagram mapping entire authentication flow from frontend to backend including validation, refresh, and 401 handling. Clarified multi-device session support pattern (multiple refresh tokens per user). Discovered session persistence need while building frontend auth screens, leading to architecture redesign.

### üéØ Currently Working Towards (Top 5)
1. **SQLx Session Operations** - Implementing create_session, refresh_session, revoke_sessions in database layer
2. **Service Session Logic** - Token generation orchestration, refresh validation, rotation implementation
3. **Session HTTP Handlers** - REST endpoints exposing session management to frontend
4. **Frontend Session Integration** - Updating AuthClient to handle Session responses with both tokens
5. **Token Persistence Strategy** - use_persistent for secure cross-platform storage (Keychain/KeyStore)

### ü§î Current Uncertainties (Top 5)
1. **SQLx Refresh Token Queries** - Best patterns for token lookup by hash, multi-token management per user
2. **Service Orchestration Flow** - Coordinating token generation, database operations, error handling
3. **Token Expiration Strategy** - Choosing appropriate lifespans for access (24hr?) vs refresh (7 days? 30 days?)
4. **Frontend Token Storage** - use_persistent API and secure storage implementation details
5. **Auto-Login UX** - Loading screen flow, token validation, routing decisions
