**Language and Progress Assessment Rules**: Use measured, accurate language when discussing progress and implementation quality. Avoid hyperbolic congratulatory terms like "EXPERT", "MASTER", "PERFECT", "FLAWLESS", or "INCREDIBLE". Instead use precise, helpful descriptions like "solid implementation", "good understanding", "working correctly", or "needs refinement". Focus on technical accuracy and constructive feedback rather than inflated praise.
