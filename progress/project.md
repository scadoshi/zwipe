## Update Instructions for AI Assistants

**Status Categories**: COMPLETE = Production-ready implementation. IN PROGRESS = Currently working on. NEXT = Planned immediate priorities. BACKLOG = Future planned work.

**When to Update**: After major feature completions, architectural decisions, or priority changes. Move items between categories as development progresses.

**Development Strategy**: Focus on completing current priorities before starting new work. Maintain clean architecture and comprehensive error handling throughout.

---

**Last Updated**: Planning refresh token system and persistent authentication

**Current Focus**: Building production-ready token persistence with rotating refresh tokens

**Recent Achievement**: Designed complete refresh token architecture with rotating tokens for mobile security. Identified use_persistent hook for secure token storage (iOS Keychain/Android KeyStore). Planned auto-login flow with loading screen, token validation, and automatic refresh on 401 responses. Determined rotating refresh token strategy (new access + refresh on every refresh call) over non-rotating for enhanced security.

**Current Decision**: Implementing rotating refresh tokens (more secure than non-rotating). Separate refresh_tokens table with token hashing, expiration, and revocation tracking. Frontend stores both access_token and refresh_token in secure storage via use_persistent. Refresh only on 401 (not every request) for performance. Auto-login flow: check stored tokens ‚Üí verify with backend ‚Üí route to main app or auth screens.

### üéØ Currently Working On (Top 5)
1. **Refresh Token Infrastructure** - Backend table, hashing, rotation logic, /api/auth/refresh endpoint (Note: Will need cleanup job for expired tokens)
2. **Token Response Updates** - Return both access_token and refresh_token from login/register
3. **Persistent Token Storage** - use_persistent for secure mobile storage of both tokens
4. **Loading Screen Flow** - Auto-login attempt on app start with token validation
5. **Authenticated Request Pattern** - Automatic token refresh on 401 with request retry

### ü§î Next Immediate Priorities (Top 5)
1. **Global Auth State** - Shared authentication status across all components
2. **Authenticated HTTP Calls** - Pattern for including JWT in card/deck API requests
3. **Token Expiration** - Handle expired tokens and re-authentication flow
4. **Main App Screens** - Deck browsing/management UI with swipe navigation
5. **Card Display Components** - Render card data from backend search/deck endpoints
