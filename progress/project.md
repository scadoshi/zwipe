## Update Instructions for AI Assistants

**Status Categories**: COMPLETE = Production-ready implementation. IN PROGRESS = Currently working on. NEXT = Planned immediate priorities. BACKLOG = Future planned work.

**When to Update**: After major feature completions, architectural decisions, or priority changes. Move items between categories as development progresses.

**Development Strategy**: Focus on completing current priorities before starting new work. Maintain clean architecture and comprehensive error handling throughout.

---

**Last Updated**: After completing swipe detection with velocity and direction calculation

**Current Focus**: Building threshold-based screen rendering for swipe-to-reveal navigation

**Recent Achievement**: Built complete swipe detection system with Delta struct tracking distance and velocity. Implemented direction resolution based on both distance thresholds (50px) and velocity thresholds (3.0 px/ms). Created OnTouch and OnMouse trait implementations with proper state management. Debugged coordinate system quirks (positive Y = down in browser). Successfully detecting up/down swipes with visual feedback via CSS transforms.

**Current Decision**: Direction determination uses `from_start` (total displacement) rather than point-to-point comparisons to avoid micro-movement false positives. State reset happens in `ontouchend` after direction calculation to preserve data for CSS transitions. Speed calculated from `from_previous` delta per event for responsive velocity tracking.

### üéØ Currently Working On (Top 5)
1. **Threshold-Based Screen Rendering** - Conditionally render next screen when swipe distance exceeds threshold
2. **Progressive Reveal Animation** - Slide new screens into view during swipe (like pulling down a page)
3. **Route Navigation Integration** - Connect detected swipe direction to actual screen transitions (Home ‚Üî Login ‚Üî Register)
4. **Full-Screen Swipeable UI** - Extend swipe detection across entire interface for fluid navigation
5. **Cross-Platform Refinement** - Fine-tune thresholds for consistent feel between touch and mouse

### ü§î Next Immediate Priorities (Top 5)
1. **Implement Swipe-to-Reveal Logic** - Render target screen at threshold, animate based on swipe progress
2. **Connect to Navigator** - Use detected direction to push routes (Up ‚Üí Login, Down ‚Üí Register)
3. **Snap-Back vs Commit** - Handle partial swipes (snap back) vs committed swipes (complete transition)
4. **Optimize Transitions** - Smooth animations tied to swipe velocity for natural feel
5. **Reusable Swipe Components** - Extract patterns for other swipeable screens beyond Home
