when making commits
- please group file commits in a way that makes sense
- if you do not know if two files should be committed together just commit them separately
- commit messages should intend to be concise: clearly, simply, briefly written, short messages, usually one line
- ...within reason of courseâ€”if you are committing many changes which require multiple lines, you may have multiple lines
- no emojis
- use git diff if needed to understand what happened in the files
