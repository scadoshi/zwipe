## Update Instructions for AI Assistants

**Status Categories**: COMPLETE = Production-ready implementation. IN PROGRESS = Currently working on. NEXT = Planned immediate priorities. BACKLOG = Future planned work.

**When to Update**: After major feature completions, architectural decisions, or priority changes. Move items between categories as development progresses.

**Development Strategy**: Focus on completing current priorities before starting new work. Maintain clean architecture and comprehensive error handling throughout.

---

**Last Updated**: After implementing complete frontend validation architecture and HTTP client infrastructure

**Current Focus**: Completing HTTP request implementation and mobile app integration

**Recent Achievement**: Successfully implemented complete frontend validation architecture with RawRegisterUser type for secure ephemeral password validation. Built AuthClient with AppConfig integration for clean HTTP client management. Enhanced backend authentication with fast-fail password policies to prevent invalid requests. Established clean separation between validation functions and network request functions for optimal architecture.

**Current Decision**: AuthClient contains full AppConfig for maximum flexibility and consistent patterns across future clients (CardClient, DeckClient). Fast-fail validation prevents network requests for passwords that could never match database hashes, optimizing both performance and user experience.
