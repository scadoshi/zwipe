## Update Instructions for AI Assistants

**Confidence Levels**: CONFIDENT = Could teach others without hesitation. DEVELOPING = Successfully implemented but still learning. LEARNING = Recently introduced, needs guidance. UNEXPLORED = Not yet encountered.

**When to Update**: After major implementations, quiz performance, or when user demonstrates clear confidence level changes. Move concepts between levels based on demonstrated understanding and teaching ability.

**Quiz Strategy**: Continue giving pop quizzes in chat to validate understanding and strengthen knowledge. Focus on recent implementations and concepts showing uncertainty.

## Current Learning Status

**Last Updated**: After completing swipe detection with velocity and direction calculation

**Next Learning Focus**: Building conditional rendering and progressive reveal animations for swipe-to-reveal navigation

**Recent Achievement**: Built complete swipe detection system with Delta struct for tracking distance and velocity calculations. Implemented direction resolution using distance (50px) and velocity (3.0 px/ms) thresholds. Created OnTouch and OnMouse trait implementations with proper state management patterns. Debugged coordinate system differences (positive Y = downward in browser). Successfully integrated CSS transforms with reactive Dioxus signals for real-time visual feedback during swipes.

### üéØ Currently Working Towards (Top 5)
1. **Conditional Screen Rendering** - Triggering next screen render when swipe passes threshold
2. **Progressive Reveal Animation** - Sliding screens into view based on swipe progress for fluid transitions
3. **Swipe-to-Navigation Integration** - Connecting direction detection to actual route changes
4. **Threshold Fine-Tuning** - Balancing distance vs velocity for natural-feeling swipe interactions
5. **Reusable Swipe Patterns** - Abstracting swipe logic for any screen-to-screen transition

### ü§î Current Uncertainties (Top 5)
1. **Conditional Rendering Strategy** - When/how to render target screen during mid-swipe for performance
2. **Animation Coordination** - Synchronizing CSS transforms with Dioxus component lifecycle
3. **Snap-Back vs Commit Logic** - Handling partial swipes that don't meet thresholds
4. **Z-Index Layer Management** - Stacking screens during progressive reveal without flicker
5. **Signal Update Performance** - Ensuring smooth 60fps during rapid ontouchmove updates
