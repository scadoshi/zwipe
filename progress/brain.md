## Update Instructions for AI Assistants

**Confidence Levels**: CONFIDENT = Could teach others without hesitation. DEVELOPING = Successfully implemented but still learning. LEARNING = Recently introduced, needs guidance. UNEXPLORED = Not yet encountered.

**When to Update**: After major implementations, quiz performance, or when user demonstrates clear confidence level changes. Move concepts between levels based on demonstrated understanding and teaching ability.

**Quiz Strategy**: Continue giving pop quizzes in chat to validate understanding and strengthen knowledge. Focus on recent implementations and concepts showing uncertainty.

## Current Learning Status

**Last Updated**: After implementing multi-screen swipe navigation and swipe-to-submit functionality

**Next Learning Focus**: Backend API integration for auth flow and async error handling in Dioxus

**Recent Achievement**: Implemented working multi-screen navigation using position tracking (BasicPoint with x/y coordinates). Built swipe-to-submit by detecting disallowed swipe directions and calling validation closures. Used CSS calc() to position three screens (Login/Home/Register) with transform offsets. Added ASCII logo entrance animation. Debugged CSS centering issues and simplified form layouts by removing unnecessary flexbox. Implemented always-render pattern where all screens exist in DOM with transforms controlling visibility.

### üéØ Currently Working Towards (Top 5)
1. **HTTP Client Integration** - Connecting swipe submissions to backend auth endpoints
2. **Async State Management** - Handling loading/error states during API calls in Dioxus
3. **JWT Token Storage** - Managing authentication tokens after successful login
4. **API Error Display** - Showing network/validation errors from backend to users
5. **Post-Auth Routing** - Navigating to main app after successful authentication

### ü§î Current Uncertainties (Top 5)
1. **Async Closure Patterns** - How to call async HTTP functions from sync event handlers
2. **Token Persistence** - Best practices for storing JWT in Dioxus web apps
3. **Loading State UX** - Showing submission feedback without breaking swipe animation
4. **Error Recovery** - Handling failed submissions while keeping form state intact
5. **Navigator Integration** - Programmatic routing after successful API responses
