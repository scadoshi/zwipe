# Enhancements
    - Remove card screen
    - Update commander search to only return valid commanders
    - Update deck card search to return non-tokens
    - Refresh cards should be a button while adding cards
    - If you reach the end of the cards resulting from your query a toast should appear saying something like "you have reached the end of the card results for your filter setup, click refresh or change your filter".. Ohh actually this should be an alert since there will be more text.
# Bugs
    - First deck creation immediate navigation to back to deck list => Deck doesn't show until you go back *one more* and then into deck list 
    - Set filter not returning results at all
    - At deck creation, if commander is chosen meaning a commander image will show upon save, the "deck name" label is pushed up nearly clipping with the header
