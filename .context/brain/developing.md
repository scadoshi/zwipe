# DEVELOPING - Active Implementation (Working But Learning) 🔧

Working implementations where you're still building deep understanding.

## 🎨 iOS Safe Area & Mobile Layout (Working Implementation)
- **viewport-fit=cover Understanding**: Conceptual grasp of safe vs unsafe zones, understanding header can extend into notch area allowing content to scroll behind and be covered
- **Safe Area Purpose**: Knows safe area prevents application elements from being affected by system UI (notch, home indicator), unsafe area is where system UI lives
- **Practical Application**: Successfully implemented header extending into notch to cover scrolling content, understands the why behind the solution
- **Negative Margin + Padding Pattern**: Understands that negative margins push element boundaries upward, combined with positioning creates upward extension effect without moving visual content
- *Note: Good conceptual understanding with successful implementation, needs more practice for full confidence teaching others*
