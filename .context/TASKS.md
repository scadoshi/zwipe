# Enhancements
- Remove card screen: build UI for removing cards from deck with filtering and swipe gestures
- Commander search: filter to only return legendary creatures (valid commanders)
    - Commander rule: "Who Can Be Your Commander?
    Legendary Creatures: The classic choice, like Atraxa, Praetor's Voice or Saskia the Unyielding.
    Legendary Vehicles & Spacecraft: Introduced to be commanders if they have a power/toughness box (e.g., from Edge of Eternities), such as flagship or starship subtypes.
    Cards with the "Commander" Ability: Certain legendary non-creatures (like Planeswalkers) or other unique cards have text allowing them to be chosen as a Commander."
- Deck card search: exclude token cards from results
- End of results alert: show alert when user exhausts card results for current filter
- Order by filter: add sorting option to filters pane (Name, Cmc, Power, Toughness, Rarity, ReleasedAt, Price, Random)

# Bugs
- Deck list nav bug: first deck creation navigates back but deck doesn't appear until navigating back again
- Set filter broken: not returning any results
- Create deck layout: commander image pushes "deck name" label into header area
