## Update Instructions for AI Assistants

**Confidence Levels**: CONFIDENT = Could teach others without hesitation. DEVELOPING = Successfully implemented but still learning. LEARNING = Recently introduced, needs guidance. UNEXPLORED = Not yet encountered.

**When to Update**: After major implementations, quiz performance, or when user demonstrates clear confidence level changes. Move concepts between levels based on demonstrated understanding and teaching ability.

**Quiz Strategy**: Continue giving pop quizzes in chat to validate understanding and strengthen knowledge. Focus on recent implementations and concepts showing uncertainty.

---

## Current Learning Status

**Last Updated**: Started building deck card addition flow with filtering system and planning multi-layer swipe architecture for card browsing.

**Next Learning Focus**: Complete card filtering UI/UX. Implement nested swipe detection distinguishing card-level from screen-level gestures. Build deck metrics visualization screen.

**Recent Achievement**: Refactored EditDeckProfile with use_memo for computed change detection (deck_name_update, commander_id_update, copy_max_update, has_made_changes). Added conditional deck card management buttons (add/remove) appearing only when no profile changes exist. Built AddDeckCard and RemoveDeckCard screen foundations with Filter component implementing name-based card search, image filtering (excludes cards without large images), and success message feedback. Created helper methods: HttpSearchCards::blank(), is_blank(), PartialEq derive; Optdate::is_changed(). Planned three-layer screen architecture: filters (up), card display (center), deck metrics (down). Designing nested swipe detection system to differentiate card element swipes (left/right for browsing results) from screen swipes (up/down for navigation).

### ü§î Current Uncertainties (Top 5)
1. **Nested Swipe Detection** - Differentiating card element swipes from screen swipes based on touch target
2. **Card Browsing UX** - Implementing smooth left/right swipe navigation through search results
3. **Quantity Management** - UI patterns for selecting card quantities (respecting deck copy_max rules)
4. **Deck Metrics Visualization** - Calculating and displaying mana curve, color distribution, type breakdown
5. **Multi-Layer Swipe Architecture** - Managing separate SwipeState for card-level vs screen-level gestures

## LEARNING - Recently Introduced, Needs Guidance üìö

### üé® Dioxus Reactivity & Async Patterns (MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH)
- **use_effect Dependency Tracking**: Automatically tracks ALL signal reads as dependencies, re-running effect when any tracked signal changes
- **use_future Independence**: Runs once on mount, does NOT track signal dependencies - correct tool for background loops
- **use_resource Refetch Behavior**: Tracks signal reads and refetches when dependencies change - dangerous if updating signals it reads
- **Infinite Loop Pattern Recognition**: Reading + writing same signal in tracked context (use_effect/use_resource) = exponential task explosion
- **Conditional Update Pattern**: `if new_value != old_value { signal.set(new_value) }` prevents infinite loops in reactive contexts
- **spawn() Breaks Tracking**: Signal reads inside spawn() blocks DON'T register as dependencies for parent effect/resource
- **Background Task Spawning**: Use use_future for infinite loops, NOT use_effect (which would spawn new loop on every dependency change)
- **Fire-and-Forget spawn()**: Direct spawn() in component body for one-time background tasks that don't need hook lifecycle
- **Session Refresh Architecture**: Single centralized background loop in home.rs, individual screens use use_resource with conditional updates
- **Resource + Signal Update Pattern**: Check/refresh in use_resource, make API call, conditionally update signal if changed, return result
- **Exponential Task Explosion**: 3 components √ó use_effect spawning loops √ó signal updates = 2‚Üí4‚Üí8‚Üí16‚Üí32‚Üí64+ tasks in milliseconds
- **Debugging Reactivity Loops**: Add strategic logging to track effect re-runs, look for exponential growth patterns in connection attempts
- **use_resource Structure**: Handles `Option<Result<T, E>>` - None while loading, Some(Ok(data)) on success, Some(Err(e)) on failure
- **Async Closure Pattern**: `move || async move { }` for creating Futures that can be `.await`ed when called
- **Signal + Send Issues**: mut Signal parameters can't cross async boundaries due to RefCell (not Sync) - pass Signal by value instead
- **Navigation Effect Deadlock**: navigator.push() in use_effect causes freeze - use conditional rendering instead
- **Centralized Session Management**: Better to have one background refresh loop than duplicate logic in every component
- **Empty State UX**: Always handle empty lists explicitly (e.g., "no decks yet" message) instead of showing nothing
- **Resource Lifetime Pattern**: `.value().with(|val| ...)` closure to access Resource data, extract owned copies to avoid "temporary value dropped" errors
- **Owned Data Extraction**: Inside `.with()` closure, clone primitives and owned types (e.g., `(id, name.clone())`), use outside closure for rendering
- **Resource Match Strategy**: CORRECT: `.value().with(|result| match result {...})` - match inside with() closure, not on resource.read() directly
- **Resource Borrow Checker Fix**: Can't `match &*resource.read()` - creates temporary value that doesn't live long enough. Must use `.value().with()` closure pattern
- **Three-State Rendering**: Match on Some(Ok(data)), Some(Err(e)), None inside `.with()` closure for loading/success/error states
- **Form Pre-Population Pattern**: use_effect watching resources to extract loaded data and populate form signals with current values
- **Change Tracking Pattern**: Separate original_* signals tracking initial state, comparing to current signals before update submission
- **Conditional Update Requests**: Only send changed fields by comparing current vs original values, reducing unnecessary backend calls
- **Multiple Error Signals**: Separate error signals (load_error, submission_error, delete_error) for granular error display in different contexts
- *Note: Hook selection (effect vs future vs resource) is critical - wrong choice causes infinite loops or missing reactivity*

### üîê Backend Session & Token Architecture (Complete) ‚úÖ
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Session struct containing user + access_token + refresh_token + both expiration timestamps
- **Rotating Token Strategy**: Security model where refresh operation generates new access + new refresh token, invalidating old refresh

- **Token Hashing Strategy**: SHA-256 for refresh tokens (fast verification) vs Argon2 for passwords (slow, memory-hard)
- **Refresh Token Database Design**: Separate table with user_id, hashed token value, created_at, expires_at, revoked flag
- **Multi-Device Session Support**: Multiple refresh tokens per user (max 5) enabling concurrent device authentication
- **Token Refresh Flow**: 401 response triggers refresh, not proactive checking (performance + no security benefit)

- **Session Maximum Enforcement**: SQL window functions (ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY) with transaction helpers for automatic oldest-token cleanup
- **Transaction Helper Pattern**: create_refresh_token_with_tx and enforce_refresh_token_max_with_tx reused across operations
- **Atomic Registration**: create_user_and_refresh_token wraps user creation + token creation in single transaction preventing orphaned accounts
- **Service Session Methods**: Complete implementation of create_session, refresh_session, revoke_sessions with proper orchestration
- **Cross-Domain Session Creation**: AuthService orchestrates UserRepository (fetch user data) + AuthRepository (token operations) + JWT generation
- **Expired Token Cleanup**: delete_expired_refresh_tokens method using WHERE expires_at < NOW() for scheduled maintenance via sync binary

- **Refresh Endpoint**: Complete /api/auth/refresh POST endpoint with HttpRefreshSession request/response types and route function
- **Logout Endpoint**: Complete /api/user/logout POST endpoint with revoke_sessions handler using AuthenticatedUser middleware
- **Enhanced Error Logging**: RefreshSessionError variants include user_id for security audit trails (NotFound, Expired, Revoked, Forbidden)
- **Exhaustive Error Mapping**: Removed all catch-all patterns from ApiError implementations ensuring explicit per-variant handling
- **Scheduled Token Cleanup**: CheckSessions trait in zync binary with weekly cleanup using map_or() for Option handling, memory-tracked latest_token_clean_up
