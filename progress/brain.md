## Update Instructions for AI Assistants

**Confidence Levels**: CONFIDENT = Could teach others without hesitation. DEVELOPING = Successfully implemented but still learning. LEARNING = Recently introduced, needs guidance. UNEXPLORED = Not yet encountered.

**When to Update**: After major implementations, quiz performance, or when user demonstrates clear confidence level changes. Move concepts between levels based on demonstrated understanding and teaching ability.

**Quiz Strategy**: Continue giving pop quizzes in chat to validate understanding and strengthen knowledge. Focus on recent implementations and concepts showing uncertainty.

## Current Learning Status

**Last Updated**: Successfully integrated Swipeable component across auth screens with axis locking and shared state architecture. Fixed multiple positioning and animation bugs.

**Next Learning Focus**: Implement swipe-to-submit detection using use_effect to watch latest_swipe signal, or extract custom onswipeend handlers in form screens to trigger submission logic.

**Recent Achievement**: Swipeable component now requires external Signal<SwipeState> (always passed from parent). Implemented axis locking with traversing_axis preventing diagonal swipes. Built dynamic CSS transform system combining finger deltas (xpx/ypx) with screen offsets (xvw/yvh). Fixed jittery swiping with is_swiping flag controlling animations. Debugged screen_displacement logic to only update for navigation_swipes, preventing unwanted offsets from submission swipes. All three auth screens move together with shared state.

### üéØ Currently Working Towards (Top 5)
1. **Swipe-to-Submit Logic** - Watch latest_swipe signal with use_effect to trigger maybe_submit in Login/Register screens
2. **Alternative Submission Pattern** - Explore custom onswipeend handlers in form components if use_effect approach doesn't work
3. **App Screen Integration** - Roll out Swipeable to Profile/MainHome/Decks with proper shared state
4. **Session Management Consolidation** - Extract repeated check_session closure and use_effect validation loop into reusable pattern
5. **Profile/Home Screen Content** - Build actual functionality beyond "under construction" placeholders

### ü§î Current Uncertainties (Top 5)
1. **Submission Detection Pattern** - Should use_effect watch latest_swipe, or extract onswipeend into form components?
2. **Signal Reactivity in use_effect** - Will reading swipe_state.read().latest_swipe trigger re-runs, or need different approach?
3. **Event Handler Extraction** - If need custom handlers, how to layer them on top of Swipeable's built-in handlers?
4. **Session Hook Pattern** - Can extract use_context + validation loop into reusable pattern without custom hooks?
5. **Component Abstraction Balance** - Finding right level between reusability and flexibility for different screen needs

## LEARNING - Recently Introduced, Needs Guidance üìö

### üé® Dioxus Async Patterns & Reactivity
- **spawn() Limitations**: spawn() runs async tasks but doesn't return values - meant for side effects only
- **use_resource Pattern**: Correct tool for async data fetching that returns values (None for loading, Some(Result) for ready)
- **Resource vs Signal Mental Model**: Resources = "fetch this data and render it", Signals = "already have value, validate/update as side effect"
- **use_resource Structure**: Handles `Option<Result<T, E>>` - None while loading, Some(Ok(data)) on success, Some(Err(e)) on failure
- **Resource Rendering**: Match on three states: None (loading spinner), Some(Ok(data)) (render content), Some(Err(e)) (error message)
- **Async Closure Pattern**: `move || async move { }` for creating Futures that can be `.await`ed when called
- **use_future Loops**: Background tasks with infinite loops for periodic operations (session refresh every N seconds)
- **Signal + Send Issues**: mut Signal parameters can't cross async boundaries due to RefCell (not Sync) - pass Signal by value instead
- **Context in Async**: use_context() works in spawn() blocks since they capture component context
- **Infallible Patterns**: ActiveSession trait with infallible_get_active_session collapses Result<Option<T>, E> to Option<T> for simpler error handling
- **Session Validation Flow**: Signal holds session from context, spawn() validates and updates signal, component re-renders on change
- **Error Honesty Pattern**: Returning `Err(SessionExpired)` instead of `Ok(vec![])` when session missing - honest errors better than fake empty states
- *Note: Still building mental model - async closures returning Futures vs spawn() calling them immediately is confusing*

### üîê Backend Session & Token Architecture (Complete) ‚úÖ
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Session struct containing user + access_token + refresh_token + both expiration timestamps
- **Rotating Token Strategy**: Security model where refresh operation generates new access + new refresh token, invalidating old refresh
- **Access vs Refresh Tokens**: JWTs (self-contained, 24hr) vs opaque hex strings (64-char, 14-day, hashed with SHA-256 for storage)
- **Token Hashing Strategy**: SHA-256 for refresh tokens (fast verification) vs Argon2 for passwords (slow, memory-hard)
- **Refresh Token Database Design**: Separate table with user_id, hashed token value, created_at, expires_at, revoked flag
- **Multi-Device Session Support**: Multiple refresh tokens per user (max 5) enabling concurrent device authentication
- **Token Refresh Flow**: 401 response triggers refresh, not proactive checking (performance + no security benefit)
- **Request Type Simplification**: CreateSession and RevokeSessions wrap Uuid directly, RefreshSession contains user_id + refresh_token string
- **Session Port Architecture**: AuthService and AuthRepository traits for session management operations
- **Token Expiration Strategy**: 14-day refresh tokens, 24-hour access tokens balancing security vs UX
- **RefreshToken Self-Containment**: Struct with value + expires_at fields for tight coupling and consistency
- **Sha256Hash Trait Pattern**: Flexible trait implementation enabling hashing of RefreshToken and String types
- **SQLx Session Operations**: create_user_and_refresh_token, create_refresh_token, use_refresh_token, delete_users_refresh_tokens, delete_expired_refresh_tokens implementations
- **Token Rotation Pattern**: Delete old token, create new token atomically in use_refresh_token method
- **Session Validation Logic**: Expiration checking, ownership verification (user_id match), revocation status checking
- **Session Maximum Enforcement**: SQL window functions (ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY) with transaction helpers for automatic oldest-token cleanup
- **Transaction Helper Pattern**: create_refresh_token_with_tx and enforce_refresh_token_max_with_tx reused across operations
- **Atomic Registration**: create_user_and_refresh_token wraps user creation + token creation in single transaction preventing orphaned accounts
- **Service Session Methods**: Complete implementation of create_session, refresh_session, revoke_sessions with proper orchestration
- **Cross-Domain Session Creation**: AuthService orchestrates UserRepository (fetch user data) + AuthRepository (token operations) + JWT generation
- **Expired Token Cleanup**: delete_expired_refresh_tokens method using WHERE expires_at < NOW() for scheduled maintenance via sync binary
- **Middleware Session Integration**: AuthenticatedUser extractor constructs Jwt from bearer token, validates with JwtSecret, includes username
- **Jwt/AccessToken Separation**: Moved validation from AccessToken to Jwt for cleaner type responsibilities

- **Refresh Endpoint**: Complete /api/auth/refresh POST endpoint with HttpRefreshSession request/response types and route function
- **Logout Endpoint**: Complete /api/user/logout POST endpoint with revoke_sessions handler using AuthenticatedUser middleware
- **Enhanced Error Logging**: RefreshSessionError variants include user_id for security audit trails (NotFound, Expired, Revoked, Forbidden)
- **Exhaustive Error Mapping**: Removed all catch-all patterns from ApiError implementations ensuring explicit per-variant handling
- **Scheduled Token Cleanup**: CheckSessions trait in zync binary with weekly cleanup using map_or() for Option handling, memory-tracked latest_token_clean_up
- **RESTful Logout Design**: POST verb for logout (not GET) due to side effects and state modification
- *Note: Backend complete and production-ready, frontend integration (storage, auto-login, 401 handling) next phase*
