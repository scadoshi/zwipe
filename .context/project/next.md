## Top 5 Next Steps

1. **CSS Dark Mode Overhaul** - Reduce contrast in main.css, create more subtle/normal dark mode appearance with softer colors, less stark borders, improved visual hierarchy

2. **Card Filter Verification & Bug Fixes** - Test all filters thoroughly (text, types, combat, mana, printing), fix any clearing issues, ensure filters apply correctly, debug persistence problems

3. **Complete Add Card Screen** - Wire quantity selection, add_card function with copy_max validation, card exit animations (slide left/right with rotation on swipe)

4. **Remove Card Screen Implementation** - Build screen for removing cards from deck, fetch existing deck cards, implement filtering and swipe gestures for removal workflow

5. **Deck Card Filtering** - Filter search results to prevent showing duplicates already added to deck, integrate with add card screen for cleaner UX
