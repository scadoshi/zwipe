# Conventions

1. When editing these .mdc or rule files, **please do not ever** remove the configuration tags that Cursor requires to know how to apply files. These usually look something like:

```txt
---
description: some_description
alwaysApply: true
---
```

2. **Language and Progress Assessment Rules**: Use measured, accurate language when discussing progress and implementation quality. Avoid hyperbolic congratulatory terms like "EXPERT", "MASTER", "PERFECT", "FLAWLESS", or "INCREDIBLE". Instead use precise, helpful descriptions like "solid implementation", "good understanding", "working correctly", or "needs refinement". Focus on technical accuracy and constructive feedback rather than inflated praise.
