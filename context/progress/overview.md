## App Store Submission — LIVE (2026-06-06)

Zwipe is live on the App Store as **Zwipe TCG**: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zwipe-tcg/id6761341603

Build 15 cleared review after a metadata scrub for Guideline 4.1(a) Copycats — renamed from "Zwipe MTG" to "Zwipe TCG" and stripped MTG/Magic/Commander/EDH/Planeswalker/Scryfall references from the listing copy. In-app behavior unchanged.

Build 15 shipped over build 14 with: `Email` strict newtype across the workspace (server rejects malformed addresses at construction, matching Resend's accepted shape), fix for resend-verification reading stale email from the JWT instead of the DB profile, and email templates restyled to JetBrains Mono + sentence case.

## Wildcard slot + commander popularity pipeline (server-only, LIVE 2026-07-07)

Two serve-path features shipped and deployed the day after the band shuffle,
completing the "fresh serving" arc. Server-only — live for all users now,
except the Zwipe-select client leg which is on main and rides the next store
build.

- **Wildcard slot** (`859ffe04`): every 25-card hand the default 99-serve
  deals reserves one slot for a card from beyond the reachable horizon
  (rank > 500, the client stack cap) — least-shown first, walking deeper
  each page, suppressions/filters respected, spliced to position 17. The
  deep pool was structurally unmeasurable before this (rank 501+ could never
  accrue an impression); users experience it as a spicy off-list card per
  hand, the signal tables experience it as coverage. `WILDCARD_SLOTS = 0`
  reverts. Build found that Postgres doesn't guarantee UNION ALL order and
  that the plan's offset math would have skipped one ranked card per page —
  both fixed (as-built notes in [`../archive/wildcard_slot/server.md`](../archive/wildcard_slot/server.md)).
- **Commander popularity pipeline** (`b10c3c7f` + zynergy `1.1.0`): measured
  that `edhrec_rank` is the wrong base for commander select — it ranks decks
  *containing* a card, so 99-staples (Ragavan, Toski) topped the pool while
  The Ur-Dragon sat behind 281 legends. New `commander_popularity` table
  (decks-*helmed* per commander; worker sweeps weekly, 3,325 commanders live
  on prod, Ur-Dragon 48,535 on top) behind a first-class endpoint
  `POST /api/card/search/commanders`: popularity base with `edhrec_rank`
  fallback, bands of 25 + wildcard seeded `{user_id}:{date}` (deck-independent,
  works in the create flow), token/emblem layouts excluded from the candidate
  pool. Worker-side resolution survived two silent-failure traps (DFC
  front-face names, 216 same-name tokens). Endpoint is live and dormant;
  the client leg (`d212e93b`, Zwipe-select drops its pinned sort) ships with
  the next build. As-built:
  [`../archive/commander_select_ordering.md`](../archive/commander_select_ordering.md);
  fast-follow: [`../plans/commander_select_signal.md`](../plans/commander_select_signal.md).

---

## 1.3.2 — adaptive serve ordering: signal + band shuffle (server-only, LIVE 2026-07-06)

The most consequential read-path change since synergy shipped: **what card the
swipe stack serves next is now shaped by Zwipe's own users**, not just the
scraped synergy base. Triggered by direct user feedback (Reddit DM: the stack
served "consistently in the same pattern and sequence" every session).

- **The mechanism** (`4e67c366`…`677ffe25`, `search_scryfall_data_deck_aware`):
  cards are scored `base synergy score + W_SIGNAL·(shrunk pooled net-rate −
  global rate)`, ranked, then cut into **bands of 25** (one page = one hand); bands serve in strict
  order and position *within* a band is purely a (card, deck, day) hash. A
  different opening hand per deck per day; the same deck stays stable within
  a day (parked stacks and undo unaffected); a band-2 card can never lead
  band 1. The signal term re-ranks by revealed user taste — net-rate =
  `(added + 0.5·maybed − removed) / shown`, so skips drag as denominator,
  maybes count half, removals take credit back — and reads as band
  *migration*: a crowd favorite breaks into the opening hand.
  `BAND_SIZE = 1` + `W_SIGNAL = 0` reverts to pure score order.
- **The lesson that shaped it**: v1 used score-jitter (`W_JITTER` 0.01 → 0.04
  → 0.08 across three live Krenko tests). Every test proved the order changed
  (77 of top-100 positions differed between decks) yet it read as "the same" —
  score-preserving noise permutes positions but never rotates the visible
  *cast*, and the cast is what humans perceive. Perceived variety required
  the band design.
- **Infrastructure**: `card_signal_rollup` matview (zervice nightly refresh),
  doc-commented dials in `outbound/sqlx/card/mod.rs`. Explicit sorts,
  synergy-ON membership, and Zwipe-select are untouched. Perf: ~150 ms on the
  31.7k-row firehose worst case (window sort), far less on real filtered pools.
- Build caught two real bugs pre-deploy: NULL `oracle_id` would have NULLed
  the sort key and floated 80 cards to the top of every stack; and anchoring
  unscored cards at 0 would have jumped them above negative-scored synergy
  entries. Full design + baselines: [`../plans/suggestion_signal.md`](../plans/suggestion_signal.md).

Also in the 1.3.2 window: zite demo videos refreshed for the 1.3.x screens
(plus a new import-and-stats demo), and the deploy pipeline hardened twice —
the `.sqlx` verify step added, then scoped past the GUI crates (headless
runner lacks glib; see `operations/infrastructure/cicd.md`).

## 1.3.1 — anonymous funnel metrics, service type-erasure (submitted 2026-07-06, in review)

First instrumentation of the **pre-registration funnel** — the question it
answers: where do people drop between installing and registering?

- **Anonymous funnel events (`4e67c366`).** New `anonymous_events` table +
  unauthenticated `POST /api/metrics/anonymous` (IP rate-limited; kinds are a
  closed `AnonymousEventKind` enum shared via zwipe-core, so unknown kinds fail
  at deserialization). Client fires `app_opened` (logged-out launch),
  `register_viewed` (Register mount), `register_submitted` (validated submit),
  keyed by a per-launch in-memory session UUID — no PII, fire-and-forget.
  Funnel reads as `COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) GROUP BY kind` vs. the `register`
  rows already in `user_events`. Also widened `user_daily_activity` counters to
  BIGINT (the usage clamp is now purely anti-abuse). Related: `zcripts/`
  metrics scripts (pulse, funnel, signal).
- **Service type-erasure (`8d9bae05`).** All five remaining services follow the
  metrics pattern: `ErasedXService` twins (via the `BoxFuture` alias) let
  `AppState` drop its five generic params; every handler is now
  `State<AppState>` with zero bounds. No behavior change. Rationale recorded in
  [`../architecture/decisions.md`](../architecture/decisions.md).

**iOS build 60 / Android vc21** built + signed 2026-07-05; server (two additive
migrations) deploys before stores roll out. Store notes kept deliberately
low-key ("anonymous, PII-free app health signals").

---

## 1.3.0 — per-swipe skips, per-deck stack memory, CardStack refactor (submitted 2026-07-02)

**Supersedes 1.2.3, which was withdrawn from both stores before review started**
— its release notes folded into 1.3.0 (`210b2d3e`). Server (skip/unskip
endpoints) deployed to prod 2026-07-02 ahead of clients. Shipped as **iOS build
59** / **Android versionCode 20**: builds 57/18 then 58/19 (the profile **About
section**, `b78fd372`) were submitted first, then re-submitted as 59/20 adding
the **filter-intent + Reset** batch (`65195250` — sort/synergy now serve, Reset
returns each screen to its default, the filter dot tracks any real change, and
the filter sheet collapses on close).

- **Per-swipe durable skips (`92d4d39e`).** Skips no longer ride the 30s usage
  batch (which lost them to a quick app kill and dropped them on HTTP failure):
  `POST /deck/{id}/suppressions` fires on every left swipe and
  `DELETE /deck/{id}/suppressions/{oracle_id}` on undo. Server batch ingest
  kept for old clients; no migration.
- **Per-deck stack memory (`9a10593c`, `cd1e39a8`, `93ca9e93`).** The add
  screen's stack (cards, cursor, undo history) survives navigation and is
  parked per deck (MRU cache, all 20 deck slots, behind-cursor trimmed to 50
  on park), so every deck resumes exactly where its swiping left off.
- **CardStack refactor (`d7cf0f9b`, `23996173`).** All three swipe stacks
  (search, maybeboard, remove) run through one generic `CardStack<A>` with
  per-stack action models (`AddAction` field-less — undo reads the card back
  from the stack; `MaybeboardAction`/`RemoveAction` carry the card their
  commit removes). Fixed the wrong-card undo at end of stack, stale maybeboard
  entries after up-swipe adds, and the stuck empty end-of-stack state (now a
  down-swipeable skeleton). In-session stack cap 1000 → 500.
- **Polish (`ba8e476f`).** Card images ease in on first load and on stack
  refresh, skeletons ease in, five-bar detail skeleton, card layer padding
  bounds the image so it can't crowd the source chips on short screens,
  tighter card-details line height.

---

## 1.2.3 — swipe memory, CardFilter split, deck-list alphabetical default (submitted 2026-07-02, withdrawn pre-review; shipped inside 1.3.0)

**Server + zite deployed to prod 2026-07-02** (push `8a46a1a5`; the zite Pages
deploy needed one re-run after a transient "Deployment failed, try again later"
from `actions/deploy-pages`). **iOS build 56** uploaded via Transporter and
**Android versionCode 17** uploaded to the Alpha closed-testing track, both
submitted for review 2026-07-02. 1.2.2 was skipped for the better number
(`63d6a87a`). The swipe-memory signal tables began collecting from existing
clients the moment the server deployed.
Commits `1ff1e398`, `09d39a20`, `9a55a0c5` (CardFilter split + alpha sort),
`c9906303`/`122984fa` (swipe memory server/client), `2df42ddc` (profile System
section showing the client version), `e03ce142` (email verification actions
moved to their own Verification profile row; refresh icon replaces "Check
again"), `b1ee1b11` (privacy policy: discloses per-account usage activity +
deck skip memory, last-updated July 2026), `816fb35e` (em dash sweep: zite
copy + displayed description strings).

- **Swipe memory (FR #11, plan executed — `archive/swipe_memory.md`).** Left-swipes
  and deliberate removals are now durable per deck: a **`deck_card_suppressions`**
  set (`(deck_id, oracle_id)` PK, `source` = `'skip' | 'removal'` as provenance,
  5,000/deck cap evicting oldest) that the deck-aware search filters with
  `NOT EXISTS` — suppressed cards stop being served the moment the flush lands.
  Skips ride `HttpUsageBatch.deck_skips` (`DeckSkipDelta`, `#[serde(default)]`,
  old clients unaffected); removals are recorded **server-side** in
  `delete_deck_card` (single-card path only — bulk import deletes don't
  suppress), and re-adding a card cancels its suppression. Escape hatch:
  `DELETE /api/deck/{id}/suppressions` behind a **"Clear skips"** button in the
  deck view's More sheet (rare action, kept out of the swipe flow). Same
  ingest also starts the per-user analytics
  substrate — **`user_card_signal`** (user × commander × card counters),
  **`user_week_signal`** + **`user_week_facet_signal`** (ISO-week scalars and
  category/color facets for future weekly badges) — all FK-cascaded on account
  deletion, filling from existing 1.2.0+ clients as soon as the server deploys.
  Client half (skip buffering with pre/post-flush undo, flush-before-refresh,
  the Clear button) rides the next app release. Verified end-to-end locally:
  ingest, filtering, unskip vs removal precedence, cap eviction, ownership
  checks, clear, cascades.

- **CardFilter split (plan executed, doc removed).** The dual-use `CardFilter`
  became three types in zwipe-core: **`CardCriteria`** (the ~50 predicate fields
  + `matches(&Card)`, shared core), **`CardQuery`** (server search request:
  flattened criteria + clamping **`Limit`** (≤250, enforced on deserialize) +
  offset/sort/ascending/synergy), and **`Cards`** (in-memory collection:
  `matching`/`sorted`/`any_match` — cannot express a limit, by construction).
  `OrderByOption` → **`CardSortKey`** with the shared comparator; builder →
  `CardQueryBuilder` with `build()`/`build_criteria()`; error →
  `InvalidCardCriteria`. **Wire JSON unchanged** (`#[serde(flatten)]`,
  round-trip tested both directions) — no min-version gate; old clients keep
  working. The three client `set_limit(10_000)` sentinels are gone; zerver keeps
  `MAX_SEARCH_LIMIT` as defense-in-depth. 510 workspace tests green.
- **Deck cards screen sorts alphabetically by default** (name ascending) when no
  sort is chosen — main list, tokens, maybeboard, sideboard. A chosen sort still
  overrides; add/swipe screens keep the server's synergy/EDHREC default order.

---

## 1.2.1 — card rules dialog + launch-flash fix (shipped 2026-07-01)

Client-only (`zwiper`); no server changes. **Android versionCode 16** published to
the Alpha closed-testing track 2026-07-01. **iOS build 55** built + uploaded to App
Store Connect the same day, staged behind 1.2.0 (submit 1.2.1 for review once 1.2.0
is live). CFBundleShortVersionString 1.2.1 / CFBundleVersion 55.

- **Card rules dialog (FR #8).** A util-bar eye button opens a dialog with the
  active card's oracle text and stats: rules text rendered with real mana/tap/symbol
  glyphs (shared `OracleText`), type + rarity + keyword chips, and P/T or loyalty —
  reusing the expanded card-row detail markup so it matches the deck list. Handles
  multi-faced cards. Replaces the old "Keywords" util button (consolidated; the
  `keyword_hint` module was removed).
- **Launch-flash fix.** The native iOS/Android WebView now sets its background to
  the default theme color and hides `#main` until the real stylesheet applies, so
  the app no longer flashes white/unstyled HTML on cold start.
- **Docs.** feature_requests reconciled (#5/#8/#10/#14/#15/#17/#19/#21 shipped or
  closed, #13 "typal" dropped — sticking with tribal).

---

## 1.2.0 — deck analytics, tagging, synergy toggle + PDH/perf fixes (shipped 2026-06-30)

Shipped as **1.2.0 — iOS build 54 / Android versionCode 15** (first minor bump
since 1.1.0), both stores, 2026-06-30. Server batch deployed to prod first (the
additive migrations), then the clients. Predecessor **1.1.4 shipped as iOS build
53 / Android versionCode 14** — a rebuild over 52/vc12 carrying two fixes: the
bottom-sheet startup-flash/animation regression and clone-nav landing on stale
fields. Everything below landed on `main` after 1.1.4. All wire changes are
additive (`#[serde(default)]` / `Opdate` / the `x-synergy-applied` header) so old
clients keep working. Six completed plans were removed from `context/plans/`
(outcomes recorded here): land_signals, price_filter, deck_power_level,
synergy_pool_client_sort, privacy_policy, pauper_commander_fix.

**Tagging & profile axes (server-first):**
- **Deck tags expanded 85 → 117** — Goad plus ~30 EDHREC themes (Chaos, Dungeons,
  Curses, Snow, Adventures, Colorless, Domain, Surveil, Outlaws, Party, …). Pure
  additive `DeckTag` enum; no migration.
- **Power level + other-tags** — `PowerLevel` (WotC Commander Brackets 1–5,
  single-select) and `DeckOtherTag` (Budget/Jank/Meme/Precon/Upgraded Precon,
  multi-select) as new `DeckProfile` axes. Additive migration (`power_level TEXT`,
  `other_tags JSONB` + GIN), `Opdate`/serde-default contracts, deck-form chip
  pickers, profile + deck-list display. Plan resolved to the official Brackets.

**Search — Synergy ON/OFF (server-first):**
- A `synergy` flag on `CardFilter` makes the deck-aware search **constrain results
  to the commander's synergy pool** (membership), then sort within it — so sorting
  by price = "cheapest cards that work" instead of replacing the synergy set. A
  toggle chip on add-cards (default on with a commander); cold cache falls back to
  the full pool, signalled via an `x-synergy-applied` header that drives a subtle
  "warming up" toast. Fixes the "sort looks broken" perception.

**Deck analytics — Draw odds (client + core, no server):**
- A tested hypergeometric **draw-odds engine** in `zwipe-core` + a "Draw odds"
  section on the deck view: `P(>=1)` per category (lands + mechanical categories)
  with `<- / ->` to step from the opening hand through later turns
  (`draws = 7 + turn`), recomputed live. High-value consistency-stats
  differentiator; premium-tier candidate.

**Card data / classifier & perf (server-only):**
- **PDH commander pool fix** — the eligibility predicate compared `rarity =
  'uncommon'`, but rarity is stored as the short code `'U'`, so it matched nothing;
  fixed to `'U'` **and** "uncommon in any printing" via a correlated `EXISTS`. Pool
  went 0 → ~5,988 uncommon creatures (5,196 non-legendary).
- **`edhrec_rank` index** on `latest_cards(edhrec_rank, name)` — popularity-sorted
  browsing (commander Zwipe-select) drops from a ~270ms disk-spilling sort to
  ~3.5ms (index scan, stops at LIMIT).
- **Proliferate → Counters** — the mechanical-category classifier now folds
  `proliferate` into the Counters bucket (counter payoffs regardless of type).

**UI polish:** per-tag `×` on deck-form tag chips; land-target section spacing;
whole-card hit area on collapsible sections (incl. the accessory strip); uppercase
chart labels; a clearer `CSPEL` (Counterspell) abbreviation vs. `CNTRS` (Counters);
clear the tag-picker search on select.

**Deploy note:** server slices deploy first (project rule) on push to `main`
(migrations `power_level`/`other_tags`, the `edhrec_rank` index; the PDH/synergy
changes are query-only). All wire changes are additive (`#[serde(default)]` /
`Opdate` / a response header), so already-shipped clients are unaffected. No new
store build cut yet for this batch.

## Deck-building tooling, budget tools + suggestion signal (2026-06-29, on `main` — next version)

A large batch (24 commits) of deck-building tooling, budget tools, the
first-party suggestion signal, and UI polish — all on local `main`, **staged for
the next version build, not yet deployed or in a store build**. Server slices
deploy first (project rule); three additive nullable migrations are involved
(`land_target`, `price_target` + `price_target_currency`, and the new
`commander_card_signal` table). All wire-format changes are backward-compatible
(`#[serde(default)]` / `Opdate`), so old clients are unaffected by the server.

**Deck-building / budget tools:**
- **Land target** — a per-deck land goal (stepper in the deck form: explicit
  override, else a format heuristic — Commander 37 / 60-card 17). Persisted
  (`land_target`), shown in the deck Profile, with crossing toasts on
  add/remove/qty and a below-target warning.
- **Price range filter** — min/max price in a chosen currency (USD/EUR/TIX
  chips, default USD) on card search; server `WHERE` over the `prices` JSONB +
  an in-memory predicate. Null prices excluded when a bound is set.
- **Price target (budget)** — a per-deck budget (`price_target` + currency).
  Toasts on crossing a higher 50/75/100% band (exact %, re-fires on re-cross);
  over-budget warning; shown in Profile.

**Telemetry — suggestion signal (Phases 1+2):**
- **`commander_card_signal`** aggregate — added/skipped/maybed/**removed** per
  `(commander, card)`, no user_id / no PII. The previously-discarded per-card
  accept/skip signal is now captured. Client buffers it in `UsageBuffer` and
  flushes with the usage batch on a 30s timer **and on app-background**
  (`visibilitychange`/`pagehide` — so a swipe-to-close no longer loses the last
  window; covers the whole telemetry buffer). Verified collecting end-to-end
  against the local app. Plan: `../plans/suggestion_signal.md` — **Phase 3
  (ranking) remains** (a later server-only read-path change).

**UI / polish:**
- **Deck-view collapsible sections** — Stats / Distributions / Mana / Warnings
  grouped into accordion cards (groundwork for the future draw-odds section).
- **Filter button alignment** — mode toggles (Any/All, Include/Exclude,
  Exact/Range) now match the standard app button (subtle border + text);
  selected = accent-2; clear `×` = destructive color + opaque fill (no grid
  bleed); label-row controls sit inline beside the (centered) label.
- **Home** — a "Flavor of the hour" header on the flavor card (+ matching
  skeleton title bar); home now greets only verified users (unverified get the
  verify nudge).
- **Fixes** — bottom-sheet startup-flash (iOS WebKit transition-on-insert,
  suppressed until mounted); deck-cards column header boxed; the redundant
  util-bar clear-filter button removed from the remove screen; deck-view hint
  refreshed for the new sections + fields.

## 1.1.3 — media-day release: card names, deck-form overhaul, in-app privacy (both stores, 2026-06-28)

Shipped on **media day** — a Reddit launch post (r/mtg, ~45K views) drove **38 → 772 users in ~24h** (665 registrations that day, 738 active; the core swipe loop held clean at ~20x load). **iOS build 51** (Apple review) + **Android versionCode 11** (Play closed-testing track), both version 1.1.3, submitted 2026-06-28. Backward-compatible / server-additive throughout (audited: no `http/contracts` or schema changes). Much of it straight from launch feedback: **card names now show while swiping** so alt-art / non-English printings are identifiable (`card_info.rs`); a **deck-form overhaul** — empty fields read "Not set", tapping a field opens the format/tags picker (the separate Edit buttons are gone), Format reads as a plain input instead of a chip, and the **deck name validates inline** (error under the field, mirroring the auth/profile pattern) rather than as a save-time toast; an **expanded deck-tag set with plain-language definitions** plus **format and power-level pickers**; an **in-app Privacy Policy** reached from Profile, rendered from a single shared `zwipe-core` HTML const so app + web (`zite`) never drift (`mailto` opens via `open_url`, https via the webview); and **under-field validation with red outlines** across sign-in / sign-up / profile forms. Server-side: the auth flows **stopped policy-gating the *current* password** on login + username/email changes — a relaxation so passwords created under older policies aren't wrongly rejected; the stored-hash check is unchanged. Client fix: the register email field now **trims + disables autocorrect** so a stray inserted space no longer reads as "invalid character." **Email outage during the surge:** Resend's daily quota exhausted mid-wave (~150 verification emails 429'd); upgraded to Pro and **backfilled the missed verifications** with a one-off mint+resend (registration already swallowed the send error, so accounts were never blocked). In flight but NOT in this build: draw-odds consistency stats + live swipe drag cues (`feat/draw-odds-core`, `feat/qol-drag-indicators`). What's New copy lives in both `operations/*/.../form_fields.md`; the weighted request queue is `feature_requests.md`.

## 1.1.1 — in-app help, import/export hints, mailto fix (both stores, 2026-06-26)

Patch release, **iOS build 49** + **Android versionCode 9**, both at version 1.1.1. User-facing: a global **Help button** in every screen header (left `!`, mirroring the right `?` hint) opening a bottom sheet to **report a problem** (mailto, pre-filled with app version + platform) or **join the Discord**; **import/export screen hints**; and the fix that makes "report a problem" actually open the OS mail app on mobile (`outbound/open_url.rs` — Dioxus routes `<a href>` through `webbrowser::open`, which rejects non-`http(s)` URLs on iOS/Android, so the old `mailto:` anchor silently no-op'd; now opens via `UIApplication.openURL` / Android `ACTION_VIEW`). Server-side, the **Archidekt importer now tolerates null JSON fields** (decks that previously failed — e.g. a card with `"categories": null` — import again), and its outbound User-Agent + the email verify/reset links derive from a new `WEB_BASE_URL` config var. Also under the hood: a shared **`ScreenHeader`** component across all 15 screens, a shared **`Chip`** component, and `SUPPORT_EMAIL_ADDRESS`/`WEB_BASE_URL` env config. Android-only: the **launcher icon** was repadded to sit inside the adaptive-icon safe zone (the full-bleed Z was getting clipped by the circular mask — see `operations/android/.../build-and-submit.md`). Logo polish deferred (see `todo.md`). Rolled out to testers to get the new in-app functionality out. **Requires the server to be deployed** for the Archidekt import fix to take effect.

## 1.1.0 — Zwipe-select, deck tags, keyword hinter, card detail (both stores, 2026-06-25)

First **minor** bump (1.0.x → 1.1.0): a batch of user-facing features plus two Android-only fixes. **iOS build 48** (Transporter → Apple review) and **Android versionCode 8** (Alpha closed-testing track), both at version 1.1.0, submitted 2026-06-25. Backward-compatible and server-additive throughout.

Features (shipped from the `feat/zwipe-select` branch, merged via PR #18):
- **Zwipe-select** — extend the swipe mechanic to the command zone: swipe through legal commanders / partners / backgrounds / signature spells (a `SwipeMode` enum + a "Zwipe" chip on each command-zone field). Retires the old "Zwipe for Commander" backlog idea.
- **Deck tags** — label decks with up to 5 archetype tags. New pure `DeckTag` enum (~65 curated archetypes from EDHREC/Archidekt/Moxfield), persisted as a JSONB `tags` column on `decks` (migration `add_deck_tags` + GIN index, mirrors `mechanical_categories`). Searchable typeahead picker in the deck form; chips on the deck list + detail.
- **Keyword hinter** — tappable keyword chips in the expanded card detail with plain-language reminders, plus a "Keywords" button in the swipe util-bar opening a dialog of every keyword on the card. `keyword_reminder` covers ~290 of Scryfall's keyword catalog with a friendly catch-all.
- **Expanded card-row detail** — tap a deck card for mana cost (mana-font glyphs), type/rarity chips, oracle text with `{symbol}` glyphs, P/T or planeswalker loyalty, accent-framed dividers, and a smooth grid-rows expand/collapse. Mana pills got the card-style drop shadow + roomier circles; color identity sorts WUBRG.
- **`OrderByOption::EdhrecRank`** sort (server-additive, already live) + add-cards filter gating.

Android-only fixes:
- **Session persistence** — `keyring` has no Android backend (it was silently using its in-memory mock → users logged out on restart). Now cfg-gated: Apple/desktop keep the OS keychain; Android persists the session to a JSON file in internal storage (`/data/data/<pkg>/files/`), path resolved via JNI through `ndk-context` + `jni`. Verified end-to-end on Pixel_9a (login survives force-stop). iOS was never affected.
- **Launcher icon** — dx ships its default green droid; `zcripts/android/launcher-icons.sh` now regenerates the real Zwipe icon (legacy webp + adaptive layers) from `icon-1024.png` after each `dx bundle` (runbook step 1b).

Other: `Opdate` now defaults to `Unchanged` so older shipped clients (which don't send the new `tags` field) still parse deck-profile updates; SwipeSelect now records the select (right) swipe in usage metrics. Build re-cuts within 1.1.0: iOS 47→48 (mana-pill consistency fix), Android vc7→vc8 (the metrics line). Server redeployed with the deck-tags migration + 65-tag enum.

Marketing: **Day 333** build-in-public posts to X / Reddit / Bluesky (video of the new features). Both sites refreshed — zite demo gallery re-shot (dropped register, added filter) + feature grid surfaces the new features; portfolio's zwipe section updated and its "App Store submission pending" copy corrected to "submitted to both stores".

## 1.0.10 — update-screen redesign + external-link arrows (both stores, 2026-06-23)

First **coordinated iOS + Android release run**, both at version 1.0.10:
**iOS build 44** (Transporter → Apple review) and **Android versionCode 5**
(Alpha closed-testing track → Google review). Changes: redesigned the min-version
**"update required"** screen (single bold-red headline, accent/bold message,
framed empty header + footer bars) and added **↗** to every external link — the
store buttons (now routing through `zwipe.net/download/{android,ios}` so the
destination is site-controlled) and the TCGplayer / Card Kingdom buy links.
*versionCode churn on the Android side: 4 was burned by an upload attempt, 5 shipped.*

**Same-day 1.0.10 refresh (iOS build 45 / Android versionCode 6) — submitted to
both stores 2026-06-23** (iOS → Apple review; Android vc6 → Alpha closed-testing
track). Adds the commander-search **"Searching…"** indicator — the typeahead now
reveals its dropdown the moment a search starts, so the existing feedback shows
during the 800ms debounce instead of a blank ~1s that read as "card missing." No
app-version bump (still 1.0.10); only the iOS build number and Android versionCode
increment.

---

## Android — first build submitted to Play (2026-06-23)

The Android port is **in Google's review queue**: `1.0.9`, **versionCode 3**,
targetSdk 35, signed with a new `zwipe-upload` key (Play App Signing, Google-managed
app key), full rollout to the **Closed testing (Alpha)** track across 176 countries.
Same Rust/Dioxus codebase as iOS; the self-hosted JetBrains Mono fix makes the
Android-WebView block-glyph logo render correctly. Play account verification
(identity / address / phone) all cleared 2026-06-23. **Next gate:** ≥12 testers
opted in for 14 continuous days before Production access (new personal account).
Repeatable build pipeline + the day's gotchas (hardcoded targetSdk 34, burned
versionCode, debug-symbols warning): [`../operations/android/play-store-submission/build-and-submit.md`](../operations/android/play-store-submission/build-and-submit.md).

---

## 1.0.9 — UI consistency pass + new app icon (build 42 submitted 2026-06-23; server live on prod)

iOS **build 42** (version 1.0.9) submitted to review 2026-06-23 with a brand-new app icon (builds 39–41 were app-icon iteration; 42 = the 1.6× keeper). Rides: **new app icon** (the ASCII "Z" mark via the asciier tool — recipe in `operations/ios/appstore_icon_update.md`); **self-hosted JetBrains Mono** (full font bundled, CDN `@import` dropped — fixes the Android-WebView home-screen logo block glyphs, no-op on iOS); **profile rework** (per-field edits → bottom sheets, Delete account behind a `More` sheet, Account/Preferences cards); **deck-view** section subtitles moved inside their carded elements; **deck list** redone as one flowing row with accent stat chips + a warning-yellow card-count chip when a deck is an illegal size; **home flavor card** cached app-wide (1h TTL, stale-while-revalidate); **deck-size rules fixed** for Oathbreaker/Brawl/Historic Brawl/Gladiator; plus "To deck" → "To mainboard", an opaque chart skeleton, and a yellow-leaned Gruvbox text color. Workspace version bumped 1.0.6→1.0.9 (all crates) to keep `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` aligned with the store version for the min-version gate.

**Server + web are already live (2026-06-23):** the push redeployed `zerver` to prod (root reports `version: 1.0.9`, `/health` green — corrected deck-size warnings live) and `zite` to zwipe.net (Gruvbox text tweak). The iOS client is the only piece still in review. Per-change detail in `todo.md`. Android emulation (Pixel_9a) verified this code earlier — JDK gotcha in `operations/android/setup.md`.

> 1.0.6–1.0.8 App Store builds shipped between 1.0.5 and this entry: synergy-ordered suggestions (1.0.6), the mobile look-revamp (1.0.7), and skeleton polish (1.0.8).

---

## Gated merges — wire-format + refresh hardening (2026-06-18)

Two server-side changes that needed the propagation wait landed and deployed: **wire-format RFC3339** (server emits `Z` timestamps; the `wire_time` adapter was deleted from zwipe-core) and **refresh-token hardening** (strict single-use rotation — `FOR UPDATE` + delete check; live concurrency check passed: 4 parallel refreshes → one 200, three 401, replay → 401). `MIN_CLIENT_VERSION` armed at **1.0.5** in prod — the lowest guard-capable floor; not set higher by design (every 1.0.5+ client already carries the Z-parsing and single-flight-refresh fixes).

---

## Production migrated to VPS (2026-06-13)

Prod moved off the home Ubuntu box to a **Hetzner CPX31** (Hillsboro OR, Ubuntu 26.04, PG 18). `api.zwipe.net` now serves from the VPS through a Cloudflare tunnel; the three services run as systemd units (`zerver`, `zynergy` worker, `cloudflared`). CI runners + nightly crons (zervice 4am, backup 5am → R2) moved to the VPS; home crons disabled and the box powered off but intact as the rollback for ~1–2 weeks. Hardened: key-only SSH, ufw deny-all + tailnet-only, CI sudo scoped to `systemctl {start,stop,restart} {zerver,zynergy}`. A backup-restore drill passed first (PG17→18 clean: 115,805 cards / 24 users / 37 decks intact). Full runbook + gotchas in `../plans/vps_migration.md`. *Open follow-ups in `todo.md`: confirm the first unattended crons, repurpose the home box + rotate the still-shared R2 keys.*

---

## Synergy data layer — cache-first (2026-06-11, build 32)

Per-commander synergy/popularity payloads are computed by a separate least-privilege worker (`zynergy` — own DB role, runner, and systemd unit) and cached in Postgres; zerver only reads, never writes. Deck-aware search (`POST /api/deck/{id}/card/search`) excludes in-deck cards and defaults to synergy ordering when no sort is given; the client add-cards screen consumes it and auto-serves suggestions on open (build 32 / 1.0.6). Plan: `../plans/synergy_data_layer.md`. *Data-source strategy: check local memory before extending.*

---

## Post-launch hardening & UX (June 2026, builds 31–34)

- **First-run hints** — `hints_shown` jsonb on users + `PUT /api/user/hint`; six one-time dialogs (login, profile, first deck, deck cards, add/remove swipes) plus a persistent "?" reopener in every screen header.
- **Security notification emails** on email / username / password changes — notifies the *old* address (the one an attacker doesn't control), user values HTML-escaped, fire-and-forget via Resend.
- **Resend-verification throttle** — dedicated limiter (burst 1, then 1/60s per user); client greys the button with a matching 60s countdown + a "Check again" that flips the verified badge in place.
- **Fixes** — missing-auth responses now return 401 (were 500, from the user-keyed rate-limit layer running before the auth extractor); `GET /health` runs the combined server+db check; the "Update required" screen no longer flashes on filter apply (a Dioxus context type-collision, newtyped away).

---

## 1.0.5 — Archidekt Import + Min-Version Gate (2026-06-10, server deployed, build 31 submitted)

**Two features built, merged, and shipped in one day. Server live on prod as v1.0.5; iOS build 31 uploaded via Transporter and submitted as 1.0.5.**

- **Archidekt deck import** (`feat/deck-import-archidekt`) — `POST /api/deck/{deck_id}/import/archidekt` takes a deck URL, fetches Archidekt's open JSON API server-side, resolves every printing by Scryfall UID (`card.uid` == `scryfall_data.id`; name fallback recovers null-oracle reversible printings), and imports into an existing deck with identical semantics to the text importer. Deliberately simplified mid-build: no commander/format sync, no deck creation — just cards onto the selected board. The verified Archidekt `deckFormat` id table is preserved in `context/plans/deck_import.md` for a future opt-in sync.
- **Add/Replace import modes** — both importers carry `mode: ImportMode` (`#[serde(default)]`, absent = Add, so deployed 1.0.4 clients are unaffected). Replace makes the target board exactly match the imported list (board-scoped; an import where nothing resolves never wipes). Import screen gained pinned From/Mode/Board chip rows with per-combination hint text.
- **Min-version gate** (`feat/min-version-gate`) — server-driven force-update kill-switch: public `GET /api/client/min-version` reads `MIN_CLIENT_VERSION` env (`0.0.0` = open, live default; malformed value refuses startup), `zwipe_core::version` does x.y.z compare failing open, zwiper polls in the 60s upkeep loop (first tick at launch) and swaps the router for a blocking "Update required" screen linking to the App Store. Every install ≥1.0.5 is force-updatable; builds ≤1.0.4 ignore it forever, so 1.0.5 itself rides the old propagation wait.
- **API evolution rule documented** (`context/development/api_evolution.md`) — new request fields are always additive + `#[serde(default)]`; server deploys first, client ships second, no gate needed. The min-version gate is reserved for changes that can't be expressed additively.

---

## Card Visibility Fix (2026-06-06, post-launch)

**Backend deployed. iOS 1.0.1 / build 17 submitted for Apple review.**

`Kibo, Uktabi Prince` (Jumpstart 2022 — flagged `promo: true`) and `Wear // Tear` (latest printing was MTGA-only `digital: true`) were importable by exact name but invisible to card search, commander search, and in-deck filtering.

- Backend: `latest_cards` materialized view rewritten so `DISTINCT ON (oracle_id)` prefers paper, non-promo, non-oversized, non-content-warning printings before falling back to most recent release. Migration `20260606120000_latest_cards_prefer_real_printings.sql` also remaps existing `deck_cards` and `decks` references to the new preferred sibling so users' existing decks switch printings on deploy.
- Frontend (zwipe-core): `CardFilterBuilder::default()` dropped `promo: Some(false)` → `None`. `digital: false` stays as a default (paper deck builder shouldn't surface MTGA-only Alchemy cards). All other defaults unchanged.
- Bundled in the same iOS build: toast styling fix (CSS pairing broke when a `cargo update` pulled a newer `dioxus-primitives` commit that dropped default classes). `dioxus-primitives` now pinned to rev `02801f27` to prevent future silent breakage.

iOS 1.0.1 (build 17) replaces build 16 in the review queue. Apple typically clears metadata-stable bugfixes in 24–48h.

## User Metrics + Public Marketing Endpoint (2026-06-07, deployed + Build 24 packaged)

**Per-user telemetry, deck-completion tracking, audit log, and a public app-wide stats endpoint surfaced on zwipe.net. Build 24 (1.0.2) packaged for App Store Connect.** Numbers go live for the world the moment a user swipes / searches / creates a deck.

What's in this round:

- **Per-user lifetime counters** (`user_lifetime_counters`) — `swipes_right/left/up/down`, `searches`, `decks_created`, `decks_completed`. Single row per user, hot read path.
- **Daily rollups** (`user_daily_activity`) — one row per (user, UTC day) with the same swipe + search counters. Trend / DAU data without paying event-log storage.
- **Sparse event log** (`user_events`) — `register` (renamed from `signup` 2026-06-09), `deck_created`, `deck_completed`, `first_swipe`. Rare events only; no per-swipe rows.
- **Audit log** (`user_audit_log`) — credential changes (username / email / password). Logs *that* a change happened, not the old value — keeps PII surface near zero.
- **Endpoints** — `POST /api/metrics/usage` (private, IP+user rate-limited, accepts a `HttpUsageBatch`), `GET /api/user/metrics` (private, returns lifetime counters), `GET /api/marketing/stats` (public, sum-aggregates across all users for zwipe.net). Fire-and-forget metric writes via `tokio::spawn` so user request latency is unchanged.
- **Deck completion tracking** — after any deck-card mutation (create / update / delete / import / deck-profile update / clone) the handler reloads the deck, runs `validate_deck`, and if it just became valid stamps `decks.first_completed_at` + emits a `DeckCompleted` event. Idempotent: subsequent invalid→valid transitions don't re-fire.
- **Client-side telemetry buffer** — `zwiper/.../components/telemetry/` keeps four atomic swipe counters + a search counter in memory, flushes every 30s via the existing session upkeeper, drops the batch on HTTP failure (vanity data isn't worth retry plumbing).
- **Public marketing endpoint + CF cache** — `/api/marketing/stats` returns `{cards_swiped, searches, decks_created}` (single `SUM` over `user_lifetime_counters`). Cloudflare Cache Rule `starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/api/marketing/")` with 2h Edge TTL (CF free-plan minimum). Origin gets one hit per POP per 2 hours.
- **zite stats strip** — three-stat block in the home hero ("Cards swiped · Searches run · Decks created") fetched during SSR via `use_resource`. Hides itself on error. Stats refresh on each GH Pages rebuild (acceptable for vanity; cron rebuild can be added if staleness ever bothers anyone).
- **UTC pool pin** — `PostgresPoolOptions::default()::after_connect` runs `SET TIME ZONE 'UTC'` on every connection. Backstop so the schema's plain `TIMESTAMP` columns are deterministically UTC regardless of cluster/process TZ. Spotted because `user_daily_activity` initial rows landed on a different `CURRENT_DATE` than the local psql session expected. Full migration to `TIMESTAMPTZ` is complete (phases 1-2, shipped 2026-06).

Build train: builds 21-23 (1.0.2, in review), **build 24 (1.0.2 + telemetry, packaged for Transporter)**. Build 24's user-visible delta over Build 23 is essentially zero — all the work this round is backend / silent telemetry. The "Cards swiped" bullet added to the App Store "What's New" reflects the build-23 latency wins that weren't called out.

---

## 1.0.2 Latency Pass (2026-06-07, submitted as build 23)

**iOS 1.0.2 build 23 submitted for Apple review. Full latency optimization round: CF edge caching, server-side compression, HTTP/2 client multiplexing, smaller default page size with prefetch.** End-to-end measurements: `POST /api/card/search` went from `~52ms LOCAL / ~250ms PUBLIC` to `~5ms LOCAL / ~130-180ms PUBLIC` — backend is now sub-frame; PUBLIC time is essentially the CF tunnel hop floor.

What's in build 23 (on top of 1.0.2):

- **Cloudflare edge caching for immutable card endpoints** — 8 GET routes (`/api/card/{id}`, `/{oracle_id}/printings`, `sets`, `types`, `keywords`, `oracle-words`, `artists`, `languages`) moved from `private_routes` to `public_routes` in `zerver/src/lib/inbound/http/routes.rs` with IP-keyed rate limit (60/s burst). Handlers' `AuthenticatedUser` extractors removed. zwiper's API client drops `bearer_auth` on those calls so CF's "don't cache authenticated requests" safety rail no longer triggers. CF Cache Rule with `starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/api/card/")` + 24h Edge TTL. Verified via `zcripts/latency/cf_cache_verify.sh` — converged to 6/6 HIT once POPs warmed. Cache-hit responses skip the tunnel entirely (~5-10ms).
- **HTTP response compression** — `tower-http`'s `CompressionLayer` added to the Axum stack (`zerver/src/lib/inbound/http/mod.rs`). gzip + brotli via Accept-Encoding negotiation. `/api/card/search` body went 39690b → 16444b on the wire (59% smaller). `/api/deck` body went 3996b → 727b (82% smaller).
- **HTTP/2 client multiplexing** — workspace reqwest gained the `http2` feature. Reqwest auto-negotiates h2 via ALPN with CF, so the 4 parallel `get_card` calls in `deck/card/view.rs` (commander + partner + background + signature spell) now multiplex over a single connection instead of running sequentially.
- **Smaller search pages with prefetch** — `CardFilter::default_limit()` and `CardFilterBuilder::default()` lowered from 100 → 25 in zwipe-core. Swipe stack's `pagination_limit` matched at 25 and `load_more_threshold` tightened from 15 → 5 cards. Compounding win on search: DB query returns 4× fewer rows, serialization is 4× cheaper, then gzip on top. Drove LOCAL search from ~52ms to ~5ms.
- **Roadmap doc** — `context/archive/latency_optimization.md` captures the measurement-driven decision process. `zcripts/latency/probe.sh` and `cf_cache_verify.sh` document how to re-measure.

Build train: build 21 (1.0.2 polish, in review), build 22 (1.0.2 cache routes, replaced before delivery), build 23 (1.0.2 full latency pass, current submission).

---

## 1.0.2 Polish Pass (2026-06-07, submitted)

**iOS 1.0.2 build 21 submitted for Apple review. New gruvbox app icon, polish across filters/render/loading states.**

What's in 1.0.2:

- **In-deck filter fixes** (`filter_cards.rs`) — basic types include/exclude, set include/exclude, "Is commander in <format>", "Is legal in <format>", plus rarity sort tier order (Common < Uncommon < Rare < Mythic < Bonus < Special via derived `Ord`).
- **Card image rendering** — `FlippableCardImage` reworked so card art renders with cleanly rounded corners and bounded sizing across the swipe stack, printing carousel, and image preview. Root cause: wrapper inherited `flex: 1` from `.card-image`/`.carousel-card-image` and stretched in column-flex parents, letterboxing the actual card content and putting the rounded clip on empty space. Fix moves sizing onto the img element (`width: auto; height: auto; max-width/max-height: 100%`, relying on `<img>`'s intrinsic aspect ratio) with per-context max-height caps on the wrapper.
- **Loading skeletons** — deck list, deck view (profile + stats with bordered info-list rendition matching the real `.info-list`), deck cards list, edit deck form, printing sheet, home flavor text.
- **Saving / submitting states** — login shows "Logging in...", register shows "Creating...", profile/preferences/deck edit screens show "Saving..." with Back disabled. Fixed pre-existing race in `login.rs`/`register.rs` where `is_loading.set(false)` ran outside the spawn block, so the loading state never actually appeared.
- **Password show/hide toggle** — single `TextInput` change wires a Show/Hide button onto every password field (login, register, change password, change username, change email password confirm, delete account dialog).
- **AlertDialog backdrop restored** — `dioxus-primitives` deliberately doesn't emit an overlay div for the dim backdrop. Wrapper now renders the `.alert-dialog-overlay` sibling when open.
- **New app icon** — gruvbox tan Z on `#282828`. Source 1024×1024 master flattened to strip alpha, scaled to all required sizes. Process documented in `context/operations/ios/appstore_icon_update.md`.

Build train: build 18 (1.0.2 orphan from prior misclick), build 19 (1.0.1, shipped), build 20 (1.0.2, replaced before delivery), build 21 (1.0.2, current submission). Apple typically clears polish releases in 24–48h with no metadata changes.

---

## DFC Handling (2026-06-06, same day as card visibility fix)

**Front face rendering + flip control. iOS build 19 packaged as 1.0.1 to replace build 17 in the open review queue (since 1.0.1 hasn't published yet, all build numbers attach to the same train). Build 18 was uploaded as 1.0.2 by mistake and is now an orphan in App Store Connect — harmless, can be ignored.**

Double-faced layouts (transform, modal_dfc) store their image URLs inside `card_faces[].image_uris` rather than the top-level `image_uris` that single-faced cards use. Zwiper had zero `card_faces` references anywhere — so `Delver of Secrets`, `Valki, God of Lies`, and every transform/MDFC card rendered as a blank image surface AND was filtered out of search results by a client-side "must have top-level image" filter.

- **zwipe-core**: `ScryfallData::primary_image_url(ImageSize)` and `face_image_url(idx, size)` fall back to `card_faces[face_index].image_uris` when top-level is `None`. Every render site replaced. `face_count()` reports `card_faces.len()` only when all faces have their own image URIs, so split / adventure layouts (single image, no per-face URIs) stay single-faced for rendering purposes.
- **zwiper**: new `FlippableCardImage` component owns face-index state and renders the `<img>` plus a "Flip" squircle button when `face_count() > 1`. Wired into swipe stack (top card only — peeking cards stay plain), printing carousel + single-printing view, image preview modal. Wrapper has `aspect-ratio: 5/7` only when flippable so the button hugs the actual card edge regardless of container size.
- **Meld pieces** continue to render correctly via the existing top-level-image path; flipping to the melded back is out of scope.
