## Update Instructions for AI Assistants

**Confidence Levels**: CONFIDENT = Could teach others without hesitation. DEVELOPING = Successfully implemented but still learning. LEARNING = Recently introduced, needs guidance. UNEXPLORED = Not yet encountered.

**When to Update**: After major implementations, quiz performance, or when user demonstrates clear confidence level changes. Move concepts between levels based on demonstrated understanding and teaching ability.

**Quiz Strategy**: Continue giving pop quizzes in chat to validate understanding and strengthen knowledge. Focus on recent implementations and concepts showing uncertainty.

## Current Learning Status

**Last Updated**: After completing deck card HTTP API implementation with nested resource routes

**Next Learning Focus**: Auth domain security operations consolidation

**Recent Achievement**: Successfully completed deck card HTTP API implementation with solid RESTful design principles.
