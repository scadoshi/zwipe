## Where Elixir Could Shine

### Potential Future Features That Favor Elixir:

1. **Real-time Deck Sharing**: Live collaborative deck building
2. **Live Tournament Tracking**: Real-time match updates
3. **Chat Features**: In-app messaging between players
4. **Live Card Price Updates**: WebSocket-based price streaming
5. **Real-time Notifications**: Push notifications for new sets/cards
6. **Multiplayer Features**: Live draft simulations

### Current App Scope vs Elixir Strengths:

```
Your Current Needs:     Elixir's Strengths:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Card CRUD ops       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Real-time features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User management     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ High concurrency  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deck storage        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Fault tolerance
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Simple API          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Live updates
```

**Verdict**: Elixir's strengths don't align strongly with your current simple requirements.

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Development (Next 3-6 months):

**ü•á Ruby on Rails** 
- Fastest path to MVP
- Matches your development speed priority
- Excellent for your current feature set
- Great learning experience with Rails conventions

**ü•à Rust**
- If you want to deepen Rust knowledge
- Performance benefits you won't notice yet
- Slower development trade-off

**ü•â Elixir**
- Only if you're excited about functional programming
- Good long-term choice if you plan real-time features
- Steepest learning curve

### For Long-term (6+ months):

If you plan to add real-time features like live deck sharing, collaborative building, or chat functionality, **Elixir becomes much more attractive**.

### Hybrid Approach:

Start with **Ruby on Rails** for rapid development, then consider **Elixir microservices** for specific real-time features if needed later.

   - Learning ‚Üí **Elixir** or **Rust**

2. **Future features**: Will you add real-time functionality?
   - Yes ‚Üí **Elixir**
   - No ‚Üí **Ruby**

3. **Comfort vs Growth**: Stick with familiar or expand skills?
   - Familiar ‚Üí **Rust**
   - Expand ‚Üí **Ruby** or **Elixir**

## UPDATED DECISION (January 2025)

After initial Rails exploration and careful consideration, **Rust** has been selected as the backend language for the MTG deck builder.

### Rationale for Rust Choice:
- **Developer Familiarity**: Rust is Scotty's primary language and comfort zone
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error catching prevents runtime issues
- **Performance**: Excellent response times and resource efficiency
- **Learning Opportunity**: Deepen expertise in preferred language
- **Production Ready**: Mature ecosystem with Axum/Actix-web frameworks
- **Long-term Value**: Building expertise in systems programming

### Trade-offs Accepted:
- **Development Speed**: Acknowledging longer initial development time
- **Boilerplate**: More setup code compared to Rails conventions
- **Learning Curve**: More complex than Rails for rapid prototyping

### Selected Tech Stack:
- **Backend**: Rust with Axum framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Diesel ORM
- **Frontend**: Flutter (unchanged)
- **Authentication**: JWT with argon2 password hashing

This decision prioritizes long-term maintainability, performance, and leveraging existing Rust expertise over rapid prototyping speed.
