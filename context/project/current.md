# Currently Working On 🎯

Active development tasks and immediate focus areas.

**Last Updated**: Completed comprehensive documentation of entire backend domain layer (zerver).

**Current Focus**: Continue documentation with lighter touch - focus on high-value items only, avoid over-documenting obvious code.

**Recent Achievements**:
- **Complete Domain Layer Documentation**: All zerver domain code fully documented (0 warnings)
- **Scryfall Field Mappings**: All ~100 fields with explanations for confusing terminology
- **Service Layer Documentation**: Auth, card, deck, user, health services with architectural patterns
- **Port Traits Documentation**: All repository and service interfaces with comprehensive method docs
- **Documentation Quality**: Explains design decisions, security patterns, performance considerations
- **Progress**: Eliminated 263 documentation warnings (820 → 557)

**Next Documentation Session**: Pull back on verbosity, focus only on high-value documentation items (complex logic, non-obvious behavior, public APIs).

## Top 5 Priorities

1. **Documentation Refinement** - Continue with lighter touch, avoid over-documenting self-explanatory code

2. **Frontend Documentation** - Document Leptos UI components and routing with focus on complex state management

3. **Adapter Layer Documentation** - HTTP handlers and database repositories (selective, high-value only)

4. **Return to Feature Development** - Resume card management workflows after documentation pass

5. **Performance Optimization** - Review documented patterns for optimization opportunities
