## Commit Guidelines

- Concise, one-line messages (multi-line only when many changes)
- Group related files logically
- No emojis
- Use `git diff` to understand changes before committing
- **Never** include AI-agent signatures in your commits.
    - Example: "Written with the help of Claude Opus 4.5"
    - Never commit with something like this in your message.
