- **Request Pattern Standardization**: Discovered `.json()` convenience method (auto-serializes + sets Content-Type), replaced manual `.header()` + `.body(serde_json::to_string())`
- **Authentication Helper Discovery**: Standardized on `.bearer_auth()` replacing manual `format!("Bearer {}")` header construction
- **Massive Code Reduction**: Eliminated 215 lines (360 deleted, 145 added) - removed 10+ error type definitions with associated From impls
- **Client Method Unification**: Refactored login, register, logout, refresh, change_username, change_email, change_password, create_deck, delete_deck, get_deck_profiles - all follow identical pattern
- **New Methods from Scratch**: Built get_deck and update_deck_profile following established patterns - proved architecture is learnable and consistent
- **Call Site Simplification**: UI components now handle single ApiError type with `.to_string()` for display - no complex matching needed
- **Backend Alignment**: Added Serialize to HttpUpdateDeckProfileBody, Deserialize to Deck for frontend consumption
- **Production Readiness**: HTTP client layer now feels production-ready with minimal boilerplate and consistent error handling

### üé® Session: Complete Deck Profile CRUD Implementation
**Independent Achievements:**
- **EditDeckProfile Screen**: Built complete 362-line edit form with pre-population, debounced search, change tracking
- **Conditional Updates**: Implemented pattern tracking original vs current values, sending only changed fields
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Discovered and fixed ownership validation negation error affecting 5 repository operations
- **Error Handling**: Separate signals for load_error, submission_error, delete_error providing granular user feedback
- **Domain Model Extension**: Updated UpdateDeckProfile to support commander_id and copy_max with Option<Option<T>> pattern
- **Dynamic SQL**: Extended QueryBuilder with conditional push for name, commander_id, copy_max fields
- **ID Bug Resolution**: Debugged commander blanking issue, fixed by sending card_profile.id instead of scryfall_data.id
- **CSS Problem Solving**: Fixed button cutoff by adding max-height to commander images and overflow-y to swipeable

**Strengths:**
- **Debugging Persistence**: Traced commander issue through full stack (frontend ‚Üí domain ‚Üí SQLx) to identify root cause
- **Change Detection Logic**: Implemented clean pattern comparing current vs original state before building update requests
- **Error Granularity**: Recognized need for separate error states (load vs submission vs delete) for better UX
- **View/Edit Separation**: Understood value of separating read-only viewing from editable form concerns
- **Option Semantics**: Grasped Option<Option<T>> pattern for distinguishing "no change" from "set to None"

**Key Learnings:**
- **Pre-Population Pattern**: use_effect watching resources, extracting data, populating form signals with current values
- **Negation Bugs**: Missing `!` in ownership checks can silently invert security logic - critical to test authorization paths
- **Foreign Key IDs**: Must use database primary keys (card_profile.id), not external IDs (scryfall_data.id) for relationships
- **Conditional SQL Building**: QueryBuilder allows elegant dynamic queries without string concatenation vulnerabilities
- **CSS Overflow Management**: overflow-y + max-height constraints prevent content from pushing elements off-screen

## Architectural Decision Guidelines

### ‚úÖ Established Patterns
- **Service Layer**: Service<R> and Service<DR, CR> for single and cross-domain operations
- **Error Handling**: Two-tier strategy (user-facing vs internal) with comprehensive domain error mapping
- **Security**: AuthenticatedUser-based operations, information disclosure prevention
- **Database**: Composite keys where natural, SQLx with custom types, transaction consistency
- **HTTP**: RESTful design with path parameters, nested resources, proper status codes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Principles
- **Services orchestrate, repositories persist** - Keep domain boundaries clean through composition
- **Domain-first security** - Validation at domain layer, not adapter layer
- **Defensive programming** - TryFrom at all boundaries, trust no external data
- **Strategic simplification** - Choose maintainable solutions over theoretical approaches
