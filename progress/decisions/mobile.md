## Real Talk: Is Native Worth It?

### For Your App Specifically:

**What you're building:**
- Card swiping interface (like Tinder)
- Lists and forms
- Image display
- Basic animations

**Native advantages you'd get:**
- Slightly smoother animations
- Platform-specific UI patterns
- Better integration with platform features

**Native disadvantages for you:**
- **Cannot develop iOS at all** on Linux
- Double the development time
- Two codebases to maintain
- Need to learn Swift + Kotlin

### The Reality Check

Your app is **not complex enough** to justify native development, especially given your constraints:

1. **Simple UI**: Card swiping can be done well in Flutter
2. **No Complex Features**: No need for deep platform integration
3. **Solo Developer**: Maintaining two codebases is a burden
4. **Linux Limitation**: iOS development is practically impossible

    pub mana_cost: Option<String>,
    pub card_type: String,
    // ... same struct used in Axum backend
}

// Frontend component using familiar Rust
#[component]
fn CardSwiper(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let cards = use_state(&cx, || Vec::<Card>::new());
    
    render! {
        div {
            class: "card-swiper",
            for card in cards.iter() {
                CardView { card: card.clone() }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

6. **Full Stack Rust**: Become expert in one ecosystem rather than split focus

**The Trade-offs You Accept:**
- Smaller ecosystem (but adequate for your app)
- Less documentation (but Rust skills transfer)
- Fewer examples (but simpler to debug/reason about)

### **Hybrid Approach Consideration:**
```
MVP Strategy:
├── Start with Dioxus for core app
├── If you hit major blockers:
│   ├── Evaluate specific problem
│   ├── Consider Flutter migration
│   └── Or solve with platform-specific code
└── Web version comes free with Dioxus
```

### **When to Reconsider:**
- Complex platform integrations needed (camera, AR, etc.)
- Team scaling requires broader developer hiring pool
- Performance issues that require Flutter's optimizations
- Ecosystem gaps that can't be filled

**Bottom Line**: Given your Rust expertise and relatively simple UI requirements, Dioxus offers significant advantages in development velocity and code sharing. The ecosystem trade-offs are manageable for your use case.
